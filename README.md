# hidden-markov
Algorithms for decoding Hidden Markov Models in C.

Standard Viterbi Algorithm for post-processing.

Implementation of the On-line Viterbi Algorithm for almost real time processing.
The version chosen for the on-line algorithm is the one found in "The on-line Viterbi algorithm" (Master’s Thesis) by 
Rastislav Šrámek.

stdViterbi.c implements the Standard Viterbi Algorithm.
